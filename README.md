# imvu-cleaner

IMVU Cleaner is a utility for cleaning common IMVU related folders. 


### Features 

- Cache Cleaning

      Deletes all of the IMVU classic client cache files

      Over time the classic client can become slow as the cache builds up to several 
      hundred megabytes or a few gigabytes. This can causes it to take longer to load the 
      user's inventory, the shop and many other places depending on the user's hardware.
      
- Log Cleaning

      Deletes the IMVU log files
      
      Log files can contain sensitive data such as chat history and account information. Over time multiple
      log files are created. Deleting them can protect your privacy and make it easier to find the relevant log files 
      if necessary as they are generated when logging in and when a crash occurs.
